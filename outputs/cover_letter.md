I am excited to apply my experience in PyTorch, TensorFlow, Docker, Computer Vision to your machine learning needs. I have delivered production-ready models, built reliable data preprocessing and feature engineering pipelines, and collaborated closely with stakeholders to ship maintainable solutions. I focus on clarity, reproducibility, and measurable outcomes, and I’m comfortable working across training, evaluation, and containerized deployment. I’m eager to contribute that mindset and momentum to your team. I also value readable code, version control, and thoughtful documentation to support team velocity.
